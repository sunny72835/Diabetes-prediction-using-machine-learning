# Diabetes-prediction-using-machine-learning
In this project I have implemented diabetes prediction model using five machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision tree, Random forest and Support vector machine. The dataset contains 7 features and has binary outcome which shows that if a person has the diabetes or not. In machine learning choice of correct method for classification depends on various factors and there is no one correct method that works across all possible scenarios. So, I have tried to implement these five technics, tuning their optimal performance for this problem and comparison of  these algorithms.
